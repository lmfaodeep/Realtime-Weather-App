Real-Time Weather App - Final Project Report
1. Introduction
This project is a Real-Time Weather App developed using Python, Streamlit, and the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows
users to search weather conditions for any city in real-time and provides a 5-day temperature forecast.
2. Abstract
The Real-Time Weather App is designed to help users instantly check the current weather and forecast for cities around
the world. It uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time temperature, humidity, weather conditions, sunrise/sunset
times, and visual forecast charts. The app supports dynamic icons and unit toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
3. Tools Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Web Framework: Streamlit
- API: OpenWeatherMap
- Data Visualization: Plotly
- Libraries: requests, datetime
4. Steps Involved in Building the Project
1. Integrated OpenWeatherMap API for fetching real-time and forecast data.
2. Created a Streamlit UI with input for city names and unit toggle (C/F).
3. Displayed current temperature, humidity, condition, sunrise and sunset time.
4. Added a 5-day temperature forecast chart using Plotly.
5. Displayed dynamic weather icons for better visual feedback.
5. Conclusion
The Real-Time Weather App demonstrates how APIs and Python frameworks can be combined to build interactive,
real-world applications. The project helped enhance skills in API integration, data handling, visualization, and UI design
using Streamlit.
